🕷 Spider Robot Control System (PS2 Controlled)
Overview
This project is a four-legged spider robot controlled by servo motors and operated via a PlayStation 2 (PS2) controller.
The main objective is to study leg coordination, gait sequencing, and embedded control logic for multi-legged robotic systems.
The project focuses on angle-based servo control and gait pattern design, rather than full inverse kinematics, to validate mechanical motion and timing behavior.
System Architecture
Microcontroller: Arduino-compatible board
Actuators: 8 Servo motors
2 DOF per leg (Pivot + Lift)
Controller: PS2 Gamepad
Communication: PS2 controller interface (PS2X library)

Spider Robot Legs
Mechanical Structure
Each leg consists of:
Pivot Joint – controls forward/backward or lateral motion
Lift Joint – controls vertical leg lifting
Degrees of Freedom (DOF):
2 DOF per leg
Total: 8 DOF
Control Strategy
The robot uses a predefined angle-based gait control approach:
Servo angles are directly mapped to PWM signals
Movement is generated by sequencing joint angles over time
Each movement pattern is implemented as a dedicated function
Implemented Motions
Forward walking
Backward walking
Turn left / Turn right
Side walking (left / right)
Sit-up motion
Greeting gesture (left / right)
Global lift-up & down motion
Each motion is executed as a motion sequence with:
Lift phase
Pivot phase
Placement phase
Gait Logic
Leg movements are executed in phase-shifted order
Only one leg is lifted at a time to maintain stability
Timing is controlled using delay-based interpolation
A simple state flag (isWalking) prevents overlapping commands

Kinematics (Conceptual)
This project does not implement full inverse kinematics.
Instead:
Motion is generated using predefined joint angles
Each leg follows a simple 2D conceptual model
The focus is on coordination, timing, and control logic
This approach allows validation of mechanical limits and gait stability
before upgrading to full kinematic modeling.
Limitations
Open-loop control (no sensor feedback)
No force or torque sensing
No inverse kinematics
Delay-based timing (non-RTOS)
Future Improvements
Implement forward and inverse kinematics
Add IMU for balance feedback
Replace delay-based logic with state machine scheduler
Migrate to RTOS-based task management
Integrate wireless communication (WiFi / Bluetooth)
Key Learning Outcomes
